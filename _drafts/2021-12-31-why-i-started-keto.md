summary: Reasons why I started keto
---

Let me start by saying I think having an optimal health is really paramount to living a good life. What's the point to live a long life if its in pain and you are limited by your body? I heard multiple persons saying the 30s is when the body start to ready feels older and not as sharp as before. What if it didn't have to be this way? 

This is why at the beginning of 2020 I really started looking into nutrition and training. I first started looking into traditional ways with the canadian food guideline and by consulting some free class and a nutritionist. I did at least three months of portion control and consistent training with great difficulty to get to the physique and health that I wanted. I didn't get there, but did loose some weight. It was difficult and didn't feel natural.

At this point I was believing in what the society use or used to tell us about nutrition:
* Eat your portions of vegetable and fruit
* Don't eat red meat more than once per week
* Don't eat saturated fat or fat too much
* Eat everything in moderation
* Eat each group of macro-nutrient (protein, carbs and fat)
* Carbs are needed in an healthy diet
* Don't eat processed food or fast food
* Try to eat fish at least once a week
* Trans fat is bad

At this point, I felt like having stomach problems was my destiny and that obtaining the perfect fat percentage was only possible for celebrity and person that had cook and nutritionist following them all days. I was a bit reticent to try new diet, because I though that the traditional diet was backed by science and all the other diets where just fad.

Its only when one of my favorite climber and  master graduate in both sport and nutrition Dave Macleod did a [4h video on keto with a 150 scientific paper references](https://www.davemacleod.com/blog/keto), that I though I will learn a bit about this, although I was telling myself it was not in order to actually try it but just to learn something new.

I though I would only watch the video for 20 min. My intuition were wrong! I end up with a rabbit hole of more than 60 hours of looking at science backed video, articles and book around low carbs, keto and carnivore diet. This has changed my previous belief a ton! Now I only belief in the last three  points from my previous belief list.

After this change of my beliefs, I decided to try and make an experiment to see if this was really something that could help my health. Here are the reasons and the result for each of aspect I tracked.

## IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)
Before starting keto, I was bi-weakly in stomach pain. Where I had to pause activities such as working with co-worker to take breaks. I also had frequent diarrhea and couldn't tolerate spicy food.

I wanted to know if this could be fixed. In the last months and a half, I can say that I had no stomach pain episode so far nor other bowel problem. I haven't tried spicy food yet so I can suppose its still a problem until I verify. Other honorable mention are that I feel less bloated and have less gas.

Why would the keto or a low carb diet make this better? 


## Craving, feeling not in control and feeling guilty
 - portion control
 - sugar

## Inflammation
  - bloating
  - Bi weekly stomach hurt

## Energy level

## Mood and depression

## But what about cholesterol and saturated fat?

## The future

I will continue a low carbs diet. Its mostly easy except you have to rethink snacking and the role of food in your life. Food is less of an entertainment and more of a tool to stay healthy. There is still a ton of enjoyment through food, but when eating with other people it can be harder to make it fit.
