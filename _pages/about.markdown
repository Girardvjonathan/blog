Hi I'm Jonathan! Nice to see you here :)
This blog is my personal journal. A little bit about myself.

I love to learn! My pleasure in life is to learn new things, create stuff and go on adventure.

Its a bit hard to describe one self, but hopefully, you will get to know me more through my posts!

You might ask: "Jonathan why create a blog? Is't there enough blogs already?" or "What could you bring that don't already exist?". Thats some good questions!

I have many reasons:
* Help me commit and finish projects
* Strengthen what I learn during my projects
* Make a journal where I can reflect on my past accomplishment
* Share my passions with whoever end up here :)

A bit about me. I live in Canada and am around 30 years old. I love music. I play multiples instruments (guitar, piano, bass, ukulele and singing). I used to be DJ and like producing my own tracks. 

I am also an active person. I like martial art, climbing, biking, the outdoors and more!

Professionally, I am a software developer and lead projects. I love fostering good team vibe and work in concert with many people to achieve ambitious goals. I wish technology would make the essential (food and shelter) accessible for everyone in order to give them more time to pursue their passions.

You might have guess, but I am an avid reader. I like to escape through science-fiction especially space opera. I also like fantasy and read a ton of self-development books.

I also take my health really seriously and have studied nutrition, psychology and philosophy a bunch and am running diverse experiment to see what diet is optimal for me. I like cooking :)

You might catch me creating things. I like to build stuff. I built my own speakers, clap light, wake up lights and have many plans for the future!

I think this conclude what I spent a bunch of time doing these past few years. Obviously, this is not an exhaustive list! But you might see these theme come up in my blog posts!

There is also a ton of things I wish to explore in the future: more wood work, producing video, getting better at photography, drawing and painting, dancing, environment and just getting better at what I already do.

I hope you have a great time reading this blog :)
