I realized this year that I watch way too many videos on youtube! Its crazy when you think about it. I am addicted to knowledge and entertainment. Sometime watching a video to learn something is actually not about learning at all but just to pass time. 

In this blog post I share with you my favorite video that I discover in 2021. Please don't watch them all üòÑ You can select those that intrigue you. Good viewing üçø

## Entertainment

I discovered the onion video channel and laughed a ton this year. Here is one I particularly liked!

## Music & Dance
### Josh turner make his guitar sings
Classic Beatles song with an awesome arrangement that make his guitar sings with him. How somebody can play a piece as complicated as this while singing is beyond me!

### Dance videos
I get inspired by dance video sometime! I like how the artist are in the flow and shares an unique complicity. The first video is pretty emotional and the second one more energetic and full of joy!

## Nutrition, sport & health
### Dietary fat
One of my favorite video is this one which shed light into how the alimentary guidelines were created and why we should ask more questions about what we should put in our plates.

## Keto
My second favorite is a video by Dave Macleod (a climbing athlete with a master in nutrition) its pretty long but you don't have to watch more than 15 minutes to get value. The story telling is pretty good and the way the information is brought shows that Dave is trying to say things without misguiding anyone. He encourage the viewer to make its own opinion.

### Body transformation
My third video is about Hollywood and the dark side of the body transformation that we see happening for movies. Its a nice video from a new channel that really put the effort into investigation, storytelling and editing.

### Dopamine
Last but not least: Dopamine. In today's world its pretty hard to not be over stimulated to the point of starting to feel bad. There is a rising trend around detoxing from our digital life and trying to live more in the present moment by practicing mindfulness and dopamine detox. I periodically need a detox and this video helped me get into the wagon this year! Its important to use technology and not be used by it. But the odds are not in our favor, behind application like youtube, tik tok, etc. there is an army of behavior psychologists that sole purpose are to keep you from disconnecting. They want you to consume more ads and buy more to fill the void of always needing the next high (dopamine burst) ...
