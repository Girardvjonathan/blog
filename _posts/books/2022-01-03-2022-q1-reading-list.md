I love reading! Ever since I started the Harry Potter series, I have been an avid reader. It changed my life, I went from a student getting "C" to getting "A". I learned so many things and even english by reading. I noticed in 2021 that books where starting to pile up everywhere they could 🙈 This is why I did a triage and I am making this post! 

First lets look at all the book I still have to finish or start!

This is way more that I could handle and my latest Indigo shipment hasn't even arrive 😂 I also bought a nice faux-fur blanket to be sure to be cozy reading and watching the snow fall ❄️

Lets be realistic, in the next semester I wish to read a few books and will prioritize those I already started (4). Here is my shelf now with 6 books.

Much more manageable! What are you planning on reading on your side this next few months?
