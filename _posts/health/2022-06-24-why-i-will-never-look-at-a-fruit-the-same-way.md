> Eat your fruit or vegetable

Haven't we heard that so many time! Today, I want to dig deeper in the first part of this common wisdom: Fruits. First, I will start with the official Canadian guideline, then I will explore in more details what the science says. Should we eat fruits? Is the common wisdom a good idea?

## Canada's food guideline
Fruits and vegetable are part of the same category. Here is what they says[^1]:

> Vegetables and fruits are an important part of a healthy eating pattern. Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits may lower your risk of heart disease. 
> Vegetables and fruits have important nutrients such as:
> * fibre
> * vitamins
> * minerals
> Include plenty of vegetables and fruits in your meals and snacks. Try making half of your plate vegetables and fruits.

Half of my plate should be fruit and vegetable, but they don't specify the ratio. Lets says we split things equally. **1/4** of our plate should be fruits. Isn't that sweet!
In more details from alberta guideline[^2] which also add phytonutrients to the list of important nutrients.
> * To increase intake of vegetables and fruit, a good recommendation for healthy individuals is to fill half their plate with vegetables or fruit.
> * Eat at least one dark green and one orange vegetable each day.
> * Choose vegetables and fruit prepared with little or no added fat, sugar or salt.
> * Have vegetables and fruit more often than juice. Limit 100% juice to Â½ cup (125 mL) per day. 

Now, that we know what the health authority said on the matter, lets deep dive into fruits.

## What is a fruit
From wikipedia
> A fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering. Fruits are the means by which flowering plants disseminate their seeds.

The average nutrition facts for fruits are as following:
* Low protein and fat
* Mostly Carbohydrate (fructose, glucose and sucrose(mix of glucose and sucrose and fiber))
Here is a breakdown for fiber vs fructose in popular fruits and vegetable:

Fruits also contain vitamins and minerals. Different varieties contains different vitamins and mineral.
Ex: kiwi --> potassium, melon --> Vitamin A, orange --> vitamin C

Now that we know what makes a fruits lets see and it plays with our system.
## Is fruit good or bad?
The basis for saying to eat fruits is that we get nutriments, fibre and minerals. Lets look at some at the whole picture based on the previous section of what a fruit is. We will talk about fructose, bioavailability and the effect on our natural hormone.
