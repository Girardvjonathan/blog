What does being healthy means? Its easier to define what is not healthy: sickness, auto-immune disease, etc. Could we then say that being healthy means to be free of problems? What if you are free of problems, but don't practice vigorous activity and wouldn't be able to? I guess this wouldn't matter if you are able to do your daily activity, but having a good cardio-vascular system helps with living longer. 

Being healthy could mean that we should have a sustainable state to enjoy all our preferred activities for as long as biologically possible.

I personally plan on living pass my 100s birthday while maintaining a great autonomy. In this article, I will brainstorm what health means to me in order to come up with measurable objectives to implement in the next months ðŸ˜„

When I think about health these terms come to mind:

But also
- (lack of) Soreness, cramps, headache, etc.
- Sustainable habits
- Good nutrition

If we regroup by themes:

- Strength
- Endurance & Speed
  - BPM, Frequency
- Sleep
  - Energy, Mental clarity
- Nutrition
  - Good digestion, Stable Energy

# Plan for each themes

## Strength

- Progressive overload
- Create a plan for full body workout
- Print a progression table for each of my exercise to see progression in weight lifted
- Do at least 5 min training every day (1 hard set of each group)
    - Like brushing teeth this should be normal hygiene
- Reduce alcohol (alcohol is bad for hormone that promote muscle growth)
    
**What to track**: Bench press, squat and deadlift progression. Number of pull up.

**Other metrics**: Different measures of my anatomy and pictures

**North star**: Defined back muscle, defined arm and abs

### Measurable goals
- [ ] Bench press to a plate & 25 lb â€” 185 lb

- [ ] Squat to two plates â€” 225 lb

- [ ] Deadlift (good technique) 2 Plates â€” 225 lb

*Tracked through progression table*

## Endurance and Speed

- Interval training
- Biking to climbing gym - At least once per week
- One 5k run per week
- Going for longer bike ride and hiking

**What to track**: Speed and distance in runs and bike ride. Frequency of training. BPM of heart

**North star**: Greatly improve my stamina and reduce my resting hearth rate 

### Measurable goals
- [ ] 30 km/h average bike ride to gym 
- [ ] 4:20 km/min run
- [ ] bike: avg 28-30km/h for more at least 30 km

*Tracked through strava*

## Sleep

- Stop watching TV and turn off any bright lights 2 hours before heading to bed.
- Relax routine before sleep
  - Listening to relaxing music, reading a book, taking a hot bath, meditating, deep breathing, and visualization
- Regular sleep times
- Optimize environment (cool, quiet, pitch black)
- Stop drinking 1â€“2 hours before going to bed
- Go to bed only when you're sleepy
- If you wake up and can't fall back to sleep within 20 minutes or so, get out of bed


### Measurable goals
- [ ] Stop waking up in the middle of the night
- [ ] Get a better fitbit score
- [ ] Get longer deep sleep times
- [ ] Jump out of the bed in the morning

## Other objectives

**Resting heart rate**: Currently around 52. I would like to bring it around 45 through cardio and possibly wim hoff breathing exercise and cold showers. TBD

**Nutrition** is a whole topic by itself, but I will try a strict carnivore diet again. To be discussed in another post! Wish me good luck with my ambitious health goals!
